Forest Dungeon is a cozy yet tense adventure where smart choices matter more than fast reflexes. You step into a glowing forest dungeon as a lone explorer, collecting treasures, managing limited space, and deciding how far to push your luck before time runs out.

Each run is split into two phases. First, you’re offered a series of item choices—pick carefully, because every artifact has a value, a shape, and a rarity. Then comes the real challenge: fitting everything into your backpack. Rotate items, plan around fixed slots, and make tough calls when space runs out. If it fits, it’s yours. If not, it stays behind.

Winning a run earns coins you can spend on permanent upgrades. Expand your inventory with new grid pieces, unlock powerful skills like rerolls or locks, and increase your odds of finding rare loot. Every improvement changes how future runs feel, opening up new strategies and playstyles.

With vibrant fantasy visuals, short session gameplay, and a satisfying risk-reward loop, Forest Dungeon is perfect for quick breaks or long strategy sessions. Dive in, pack smart, and see how much treasure you can carry back before the dungeon pushes back.
